        About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Suganya Kothandan, a dedicated software tester who thrives on ensuring that every line of code we deploy works as intended. With 3 years of experience in the field, I've seen firsthand how a thorough testing regimen not only prevents inconvenient bugs but also instills confidence in end-users and stakeholders alike.
</p>
<p>
Graduating from University of Madras,
 I was drawn to software testing for its unique blend of analytical thinking and end-user advocacy.
  I pride myself on my ability to not just find bugs, but to dive deep into issues, understanding root causes,
   and collaborating closely with developers to ensure swift resolutions.

Over the years, I've become proficient with tools such as 
 JIRA allowing me to adapt to varied testing environments, whether they're focused on web applications, mobile apps, or intricate backend systems.
</p>
<p>
    ●  Hands-on technology professional accustomed to working in complex, project-based environments. Expertise in QA
Methodologies, such as Waterfall and agile model; good understanding of Agile with Scrum methodologies and SDLC
</p>
<p>
● Proficient in developing/writing test plans, Test Case Design, and Test Scripts based on User Requirements,
Specifications and System Requirements documents, documenting problem reports.
</p>
<p>
● Proficient in analyzing the Business Requirement Documents, Functional Specifications and Technical Specifications
</p>
<p>
Outside of scouring software for potential improvements, I'm a [hobby or interest, e.g., "lover of puzzle games" or "frequent attendee of tech meetups"], constantly nurturing my analytical side even in my downtime.

If you're on the lookout for a software tester with a keen eye for detail and a relentless drive for perfection, I'd love to explore how I can bring value to your team!
